FRIZZ 01
Key Improvements

Natural Patterns: curlnoise replaces xnoise, providing swirling, hair-like displacements.
3D Displacement: Noise is sampled in 3D space (@P * freq), fixing the original scalar-to-vector mismatch.
Tangent Projection: Keeps frizz lateral to the strand, enhancing realism.
Preserved Controls: Retains frequency, amplitude, and mask functionality with randomization.
